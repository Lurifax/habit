# Habit
Project in PHP study

The goal of project is to create a website where the user can register a profile, log in and add 'habits' to their profile.
The habits can be registered to any days the user want and should then be presented every day for the user.
The user shall also be able to mark habits done and get a view over their progress in changing the habits they like.

Update 26 november:
Updates and fixes:
-Now using function to connect to database
-You now need to activate account through activation link to be able to register habits
-Some minor fixes with error-handling and simple javascripts.

Things yet to do:
-Change password does not work, you will get an success message but the pw is not updated
-Missing progressviewer to view your finished habits and give an indication if your habit is starting to change.
-Styling and improved layout of the solution on the inside when logged in

Things to be considered if time to spare:
-The option to delete your account
-The option to delete all your executed habits from the progressviewer
